Subject: ANN: Debian From Scratch 0.99.0

Debian From Scratch (DFS) is a single, full rescue CD capable of
working with all major filesystems, LVM, software RAID, and even
compiling a new kernel.  The DFS ISO images also contain a small
Debian mirror subset that lets you use cdebootstrap, along with the
other utilities on the CD, to perform a manual, "Gentoo-like"
installation.

DFS also refers to dfsbuild, the tool that generates DFS images.
dfsbuild is available as a Debian package.

Today I am announcing the availability of DFS 0.99.0 images for
i386/amd64 and dfsbuild 0.99.0.  These are the major changes since the
previous incarnation of DFS:

 * Entire program rewritten from scratch.  Ported from OCaml to
   Haskell, with some Busybox shell scripts.

 * DFS now supports Debian initramfs kernels out of the box.  It
   continues to support kernels with enough drivers statically
   compiled to load the CD.

 * Switched from apt-move to reprepro for the generation of the
   on-CD mini Debian mirror, saving space on the generated image.

 * DFS images now use (and require) udev.

 * My DFS images are now built with testing (etch).

 * My DFS images now come with multiple versions of GCC, plus development 
   environments for C, Java, Perl, Haskell, Pyton, OCaml, shell, and
   tcl.

 * My DFS images now come with various version-control programs: CVS,
   darcs, bzr, subversion, git, cogito, arch2darcs, tailor, etc.

 * Numerous additions of other packages to the DFS images; full list
