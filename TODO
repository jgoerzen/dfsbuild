 * Add lftp back to the dfs.cfg list (or update dfshints to note the lack
   of it)
 
 * config option to copy files from existing fs

 * remastering hints such as http://www.knoppix.net/docs/index.php/KnoppixRemasteringHowto

 * Support standard Debian kernels or other .debs that expect to

   get right but more powerfull.
