      <title>Description</title>
      <para>
        &dfsbuild; is a program to generate Debian From Scratch (DFS)
        CD images.  It is highly configurable and can generate images
        far different from the standard DFS image.
      </para>
      <para>
        The output from &dfsbuild; is an ISO image that is bootable on
        i386 and amd64 systems.  It uses Grub for the bootloader, and
        in the default configuration, generates DFS ISOs that are
        bootable and can be used to repair a Linux system or install a
        new one.
      </para>
      <para>
        &dfsbuild; requires about twice the eventual size of the ISO
        image to run.  That is, if you are building a 600MB ISO image,
        you will need approximately 1.2GB free on the disk that holds
        <replaceable>working_dir</replaceable>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Configuration is accomplished through the config file given
        with -c.  An example is available in
        <filename>/etc/dfsbuild/dfs.cfg</filename>.  That example is
        commented and shows all the available options.
      </para>
      <para>
        dfsbuild must be run as root.
      </para>
      <para>
        The working directory is specified with -w.  <emphasis>NOTE:
          IF THIS SPECIFIES AN EXISTING DIRECTORY, IT IS AUTOMATICALLY DELETED
          WITHOUT FURTHER WARNING.

        &dfsbuild; does not work with Debian GNU/Linux woody (the
        stable release as of the time of this writing).  You must use
        a newer distribution for your CD.  testing is known to work.
